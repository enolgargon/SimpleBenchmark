# Contributors

## How to contribute?
Currently, public contributions to the project are not accepted. If you really want to contribute please contact me through my email address enolgargon@gmail.com and we can talk about working together.
In the future we will admit three types of contributions:
* Report problems
* Solve reported problems
* Implement new algorithms at the processor level
When everything is better on track I will give more details.
